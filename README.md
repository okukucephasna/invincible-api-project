## üß© Project Overview

This is a **simple full-stack project** that leverages **Flask**, **Flask-RESTful**, **PostgreSQL**, and **React** to create an API-driven application.
The backend is powered by Flask and serves data from a PostgreSQL database, while the frontend (built with React) consumes the API endpoints to display content dynamically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Installing React on the Frontend

The first step is to set up a React project in the frontend directory.
React provides the user interface and will fetch data from the Flask API.

You can initialize it by running:

```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
```

This command creates a new folder called `frontend` containing all the necessary files to start a React project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Installing Axios

Next, install **Axios**, a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests.
It allows the frontend to send and receive data from the Flask backend seamlessly.

Run this command inside your frontend folder:

```bash
npm install axios
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Installing React Router DOM

After setting up Axios, install **React Router DOM** ‚Äî a routing library that enables page navigation in React applications without refreshing the browser.

Use the command below:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

This will allow you to create routes for different pages, such as Home, About, or specific content pages fetched from the API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Building the Frontend for Integration

Once the React app is ready and configured, you need to **build** it so that Flask can serve the static files (the compiled frontend) when the backend runs.

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a production-ready build of your React app in the `frontend/build` folder.
When you start your Flask backend, it will automatically serve this built frontend, allowing both parts of the project to run together smoothly.
